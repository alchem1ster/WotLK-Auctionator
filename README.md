# Auctionator
### _Tested on 3.3.5a (Warmane Lordaeron)_

Auctionator is designed for casual everyday auction house users. Auctionator makes the auction house easier to use, by presenting auction house listings clearly and succinctly, and by eliminating the tedium involved in posting and managing auctions.
##### Version: `2.6.8` (this addon version designed for 4.0.1, but it works great also with 3.3.5a)
##### Original author: `Zirco`
##### [CurseForge Link to unmodified version](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auctionator/files/469905)  
 
## Features
- Fixed a bug while performing a full scan of the auction house, when the names of some items are not loaded from the server and it caused an infinity hang;
- A new mark has been added to the items tooltip - the [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) price. Calculated based on the last 25 full scans of the auction house and stored in `SavedVars`.
